# Email Notification Feature Implementation possible steps as per my research till now!

## 1. Research and Setup

- Evaluate different email delivery services or SMTP servers to find the most suitable for the project's requirements.
- Set up an account with the selected service (e.g., Amazon SES) and configure it for use in the project.

## 2. Backend Development (.NET)

### Research and Setup
- Choose .NET Core for backend development.
- Set up a new .NET Core project.

### Email Trigger Mechanism Development
- Implement logic in the backend to trigger emails based on specific application events.
- Use AWS SDK for .NET to integrate with Amazon SES or use SMTP for other email services.
- Securely store API keys or SMTP credentials.

## 3. Frontend Development (Angular)

### Research and Setup
- Choose Angular for frontend development.
- Set up a new Angular project.

### Email Content and Template Creation
- Design email templates for different notification scenarios using HTML and CSS.
- Implement Angular components to display dynamic content in email templates.

## 4. Integration

### Backend-Client Integration
- Implement APIs in the backend to handle email trigger requests from the client.
- Use HttpClient in Angular to make requests to the backend APIs.

## 5. Testing and Validation

### Backend Testing
- Write unit tests for the backend email trigger mechanism.
- Test email sending functionality with mock SMTP servers or email service simulators.

### Frontend Testing
- Write unit tests for Angular components handling email templates and triggers.
- Perform end-to-end testing to ensure proper integration between frontend and backend.

## 6. Documentation

### Backend Documentation
- Document the setup process for integrating with the chosen email delivery service or SMTP server.
- Provide instructions for configuring and securing API keys or SMTP credentials.

### Frontend Documentation
- Document how to use Angular components for email template rendering and triggering.
- Provide guidelines for maintaining and updating email templates.

## 7. Presentation

### Demonstration
- Prepare a live demonstration showcasing the email notification feature.
- Show how emails are triggered based on specific events and the received emails for different scenarios.
- Discuss challenges faced during development and their resolutions.
